# MGraph__Simple Provider Briefing

## Purpose
Create a minimal provider implementation for testing and demonstration purposes, serving as the simplest possible MGraph provider with core functionality.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement minimal Schema layer classes
2. Provide basic Model and Domain layer implementations
3. Support essential graph operations
4. Enable unit testing for graph-based queries

## Minimal Class Structure
- `Schema__Simple__Node`
  - Support for basic data storage
  - Flexible value representation
  - Minimal type constraints

- `Schema__Simple__Edge`
  - Basic connection between nodes
  - Support for node relationships

- `Schema__Simple__Graph`
  - Container for nodes and edges
  - Minimal graph management capabilities

## Key Capabilities
- Store arbitrary values
- Create basic node and edge relationships
- Support property-based access
- Provide type-safe implementations
- Minimal overhead for testing scenarios

## Implementation Constraints
- Use Type_Safe as base class
- Follow MGraph architectural principles
- Minimize complexity
- Prioritize testability over advanced features

## Testing Scenarios
- Node creation and manipulation
- Edge relationship establishment
- Basic graph traversal
- Property access and modification
- Type safety validation
