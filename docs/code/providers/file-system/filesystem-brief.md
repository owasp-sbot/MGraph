# Filesystem Representation Project Brief

## Overview

### Purpose and Scope
This document explores how to represent filesystem hierarchies (folders and files) in different data formats. We're tackling a fundamental question: what's the best way to capture and store information about files, folders, and their relationships?

### The Challenge
When building a filesystem abstraction, we need to represent:
- Files with their properties (name, size, extension)
- Folders and their contents
- Hierarchical relationships (which files are in which folders)
- Additional metadata (timestamps, permissions, etc.)

This seemingly simple requirement can be approached in many different ways, each with its own trade-offs.

### Document Structure
1. We first present all available formats with examples
2. Then analyze their strengths and weaknesses
3. Finally provide implementation considerations and recommendations

### Format Categories
We explore four main categories of representation:

1. **Standard Data Formats**
   - Traditional formats like JSON, XML, YAML
   - Focus on human readability and ease of use

2. **Object-Oriented Representation**
   - Using Python classes and objects
   - Emphasis on type safety and programming interface

3. **Semantic Web Formats**
   - RDF-based formats for rich relationships
   - Focus on meaning and connections

4. **Graph Representations**
   - Graph-specific formats and databases
   - Emphasis on relationships and traversal

### Format Summary

## Core Requirements

### Essential Data Points
- File/folder names
- File sizes
- File extensions
- Hierarchical relationships
- Clear type distinction (file vs. folder)

### Constraints
- Names must be unique within a folder
- Valid filesystem paths only
- No circular references
- Maintainable hierarchy depth

## Data Representation Formats

### Standard Data Formats

#### JSON
```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "folders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "manual.pdf",
          "size": 1240091,
          "extension": "pdf"
        }

    }
  ],
  "files": []
}
```

**Advantages:**

    </folder>
</folder>
```

**Advantages:**

    name: str
    files: List[File] = None
    folders: List['Folder'] = None
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        self.files = self.files or []
        self.folders = self.folders or []

# Example usage:
project = Folder(
    name="project",
    folders=[
        Folder(
            name="docs",
            files=[
                File(name="manual.pdf", size=1240091, extension="pdf")

        fs:name "docs" ;
        fs:contains [
            a fs:File ;
            fs:name "manual.pdf" ;
            fs:size 1240091 ;

   - Version control friendly

2. **Database Storage**
   - Graph database (Neo4j)
   - Document store (MongoDB)
   - Relational with hierarchy support

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - In-memory graph
   - File-based persistence
   - Cached operations

### Operation Support

- Move/rename items
- List contents
- Search/filter
- Path traversal
- Attribute modification

#### Advanced Features
- Versioning
- Access control
- Change notification
- Quota management
- Content indexing

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategies**
   - Path lookup cache
   - Content index
   - Metadata cache

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - On-demand hierarchy loading
   - Partial tree updates
   - Depth-limited queries

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Batch updates
   - Transaction support
   - Atomic operations

### API Design

#### Core Interface
```python
class FileSystem:
    def create_folder(self, path: str) -> Folder: ...
    def create_file(self, path: str, size: int) -> File: ...
    def move(self, source: str, target: str) -> bool: ...
    def delete(self, path: str) -> bool: ...
    def get_info(self, path: str) -> ItemInfo: ...
    def list_contents(self, path: str) -> List[ItemInfo]: ...
```

#### Event System
```python
class FileSystemEvents:
    def on_create(self, item: ItemInfo): ...
    def on_delete(self, path: str): ...
    def on_move(self, source: str, target: str): ...
    def on_modify(self, item: ItemInfo): ...
```

## Recommendations

### Format Selection
1. Use **Python classes** for runtime representation
2. Use **JSON** for persistence
3. Consider **Neo4j** for large-scale deployments
4. Use **GraphML** for visualization/analysis

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with simple file-based storage
2. Implement core operations first
3. Add caching layer
4. Introduce advanced features incrementally

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for data structures
2. Integration tests for operations
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Stress testing for large hierarchies

## Conclusion

Each representation format offers distinct advantages, but a hybrid approach using Python classes for runtime and JSON for persistence provides the best balance of functionality, performance, and simplicity for initial implementation. The system can be evolved to use more sophisticated storage solutions as requirements grow.

The success of the implementation will depend on careful attention to performance optimization, particularly in handling large hierarchies and frequent updates. A phased approach to implementation will allow for iterative improvement while maintaining stability.
