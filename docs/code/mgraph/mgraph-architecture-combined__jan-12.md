# MGraph Architecture: Comprehensive Analysis and Planning

## Introduction

The MGraph-AI project has reached a critical point where architectural refinement is necessary to support its expanding capabilities and use cases. The ability to make these significant architectural changes is enabled by our comprehensive test coverage, achieved through AI-assisted test generation. This 100% code coverage provides confidence in refactoring while maintaining system integrity and functionality.

At its core, MGraph-AI serves as a universal graph-based data transformation and manipulation system. It creates an internal representation that can seamlessly convert between different data formats while preserving data fidelity. This enables powerful data manipulation capabilities while maintaining the ability to round-trip data back to its original format or transform it into any supported format.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Provider Data Flow
MGraph-AI implements a sophisticated data flow pattern where external data formats are transformed into an internal representation and back:

1. **Input Phase**
   - External data in various formats (RSS, XML, JSON, etc.)
   - Provider-specific parsers and validators
   - Conversion to internal MGraph format

2. **Processing Phase**
   - Data manipulation using MGraph APIs
   - Filtering, transformation, and analysis
   - Graph operations and queries

3. **Output Phase**
   - Serialization to target formats
   - Format-specific optimizations
   - Data validation and integrity checks

Example workflow with RSS feed:
```
feed-abc.xml (RSS)
    → feed-abc.mgraph.json (Internal representation)
    → feed-abc.{json|rdf|ttl|json-ld} (Output formats)
```

## Recent Architectural Changes

### Domain Layer Clarification
- Introduced `Domain__` prefix for all domain classes
- Creates clear separation between domain logic and provider implementations
- Resolves naming conflicts and ambiguity in graph class hierarchy
- Establishes clear boundaries between core domain logic and provider-specific implementations

### Layer Responsibilities

#### 1. Schema Layer (Data Models)
The Schema layer focuses on defining pure data structures without any business logic or external dependencies. It serves as the foundation for type safety and data validation.

Core responsibilities:
- Defines data structures and validation rules
- Pure data containers with type definitions
- No business logic or external dependencies
- Focus on serialization/deserialization
- Type safety enforcement
- Constraint definition
- Serialization support

#### 2. Model Layer (Data Operations)
The Model layer handles all direct data manipulations, working with single model/schema pairs and maintaining data integrity within its scope.

Core responsibilities:
- Handles data manipulation within its scope
- Operates on single model/schema pair
- Unaware of broader graph context
- Focused on data integrity and type safety
- Business rule validation
- Type conversion
- Basic data operations

#### 3. Domain Layer (Business Logic)
The Domain layer orchestrates operations across multiple models and maintains overall system consistency.

Core responsibilities:
- Orchestrates operations across models
- Maintains graph-wide consistency
- Handles cross-entity relationships
- Provides rich domain-specific operations
- Access to complete graph context
- Complex business rules
- Cross-entity operations

#### 4. Actions Layer (API Surface)
The Actions layer provides the primary interface for system users, exposing intuitive, use-case driven operations.

Core responsibilities:
- Exposes intuitive, use-case driven interfaces
- Simplifies complex operations
- Provides clear, task-specific naming
- Handles common patterns and workflows
- User interaction patterns
- Operation composition
- Error handling

## Provider Implementation Analysis

### Current Challenges
1. High implementation overhead
   - Many required classes per provider
   - Significant boilerplate code
   - Complex inheritance chains

2. Code Duplication
   - Similar patterns repeated across providers
   - Common functionality reimplemented
   - Maintenance burden

3. API Consistency
   - Different providers may expose different interfaces
   - Varying levels of functionality
   - Inconsistent method naming

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Provider Template System
Create a standardized template system for new providers:
```python
class Provider__Template:
    schema_classes = {
        'node': Schema__Template__Node,
        'edge': Schema__Template__Edge,
        'graph': Schema__Template__Graph
    }
    model_classes = {
        'node': Model__Template__Node,
        'edge': Model__Template__Edge,
        'graph': Model__Template__Graph
    }
    domain_classes = {
        'node': Domain__Template__Node,
        'edge': Domain__Template__Edge,
        'graph': Domain__Template__Graph
    }
```

### 2. Base Class Generation
- Automated generation of required base classes
- Default implementations for common patterns
- Extension points for provider-specific logic
- Reduced boilerplate code

### 3. Standard Provider Interface

```python
class MGraph__Provider(MGraph):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.provider = Provider__Template()
        self.graph = self.provider.create_random_graph(config)

    @classmethod
    def from_data(cls, data):
        """Create graph from serialized data"""
        pass

    def to_data(self, format='native'):
        """Serialize graph to specified format"""
        pass
```

## Data Format Interoperability

### Core Concepts

MGraph-AI's internal representation serves as a universal intermediate format that captures all necessary information from source formats while enabling lossless transformation to target formats. This is achieved through several key mechanisms:

1. **Universal ID System**
   - Internal GUID-based identification
   - Format-specific ID mapping
   - ID preservation for round-trip operations

2. **Metadata Preservation**
   - Format-specific attributes
   - Common attribute mapping
   - Extended property storage

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Graph-based relationship model
   - Format-specific relationship translation
   - Bi-directional reference tracking

### Format-Specific Considerations

Different formats have varying capabilities for representing relationships and metadata. MGraph-AI handles these differences through:

1. **JSON Format**
   ```json
   {
     "nodes": {
       "n1": {
         "id": "guid-1234",
         "original_id": "article-1",
         "format_specific": {
           "rss": { "pubDate": "2024-01-12" }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **XML/RSS Format**
   ```xml
   <rss version="2.0">
     <channel>
       <item>
         <mgraph:id>guid-1234</mgraph:id>
         <title>Article 1</title>
         <pubDate>2024-01-12</pubDate>
       </item>
     </channel>
   </rss>
   ```

3. **RDF/Turtle Format**
   ```turtle
   @prefix mgraph: <http://mgraph.ai/schema#> .
   
   <guid-1234> a mgraph:Node ;
       mgraph:original_id "article-1" ;
       rss:pubDate "2024-01-12" .
   ```

### Core Data Structure
Define minimal representation that captures:
- Node/edge relationships
- Attributes and metadata
- Type information
- Provider-specific extensions

### Format-Specific Mappings

#### JSON
```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "n1": {"type": "node", "attributes": {}},
    "n2": {"type": "node", "attributes": {}}
  },
  "edges": {
    "e1": {
      "from": "n1",
      "to": "n2",
      "attributes": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### XML
```xml
<graph>
  <nodes>
    <node id="n1">
      <attributes/>
    </node>
    <node id="n2">
      <attributes/>
    </node>
  </nodes>
  <edges>
    <edge id="e1" from="n1" to="n2">
      <attributes/>
    </edge>
  </edges>
</graph>
```

#### RDF/JSON-LD
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "mgraph": "http://mgraph.ai/schema#",
    "node": "mgraph:node",
    "edge": "mgraph:edge"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "node",
      "@id": "n1"
    },
    {
      "@type": "edge",
      "@id": "e1",
      "from": "n1",
      "to": "n2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Transformation Pipeline

The transformation process follows these steps:

1. **Import Phase**
   ```python
   # Example RSS import
   rss_provider = MGraph__RSS()
   graph = rss_provider.load('feed-abc.xml')
   graph.save('feed-abc.mgraph.json')
   ```

2. **Manipulation Phase**
   ```python
   # Data manipulation
   with graph.edit() as edit:
       for node in edit.nodes():
           if node.has_attribute('pubDate'):
               # Transform date format
               node.transform_date_format()
   ```

3. **Export Phase**
   ```python
   # Export to multiple formats
   graph.export('feed-abc.json')
   graph.export('feed-abc.ttl', format='turtle')
   graph.export('feed-abc.jsonld', format='json-ld')
   ```
